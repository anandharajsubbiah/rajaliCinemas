    <h1>benefits of watching movie </h1>
    <h3>1. Positive impact on your overall health</h3>
    <p>Did you know that cinema therapy exists? Cinemetherapy (movie therapy) is a form of expressive therapy for
        overcoming medical and mental health issues. This therapy can change an individual’s negative thoughts, bad
        habits, and the ability to manage life events. People who attend cinema therapy are watching movies that reflect
        their current issues.

        Comedies, for example, make us laugh, and laughing for 15 minutes is just as good for your heart as exercise,
        said cardiologist Dr. Michael Miller of the University of Maryland. But don't underestimate the sad movies! Sad
        movies have a positive effect on your brain chemistry too. According to scientists from Oxford University,
        watching a traumatic movie can boost the production of endorphins, a chemical associated with increased pain
        tolerance. So, sad movies can actually make you feel good.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>2. Boost your immune system</h3>
    <p>Movies can make you healthier! Researchers have found that watching horror films increases white blood cells,
        which are essential in injury recovery and fighting disease. But if you are one of the people with heart
        conditions, you should avoid scary movies. According to some scientists, laughter can boost your immune system
        and decrease the hormones of stress related to stress.</p>

    <h3>3. Help you cope with stress</h3>
    <p>Movies are the best tool for escaping reality. If you are feeling stressed and anxious, they can help you cope
        with stress. Romantic movies and comedies, for example, can help you overcome the issues in your real life.
        Comedies have been proven to decrease stress hormone levels and blood pressure. According to the study by the
        University of Maryland, comedies and movies that make people laugh, caused people’s blood vessels to dilate by
        22%, lowering blood pressure and reducing stress.</p>

    <h3>4. Bring together families and couples</h3>
    <p>Movie nights bring together families, friends, and couples. They make us laugh and connect us, while we’re having

    <h3>5. Inspire you to be a better person</h3>
    <p>Do you have a favorite movie quote that you use whenever you find yourself in a difficult situation? If you do,
        that means that the film made a big impression on you. Even if you didn’t notice, movies have a major effect on
        real life, but also on our personal development.

        Movies inspire us to be better people. It can inspire you to make positive changes in your life, forgive
        someone, makeup with your loved one, volunteer somewhere, or anything that will improve your life. Movies often
        teach us what's good and what's not, and certain events or sentences said by the main characters can motivate us
        to change our lives.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>6. Help you learn new things</h3>
    <p>One of the biggest benefits of watching movies, especially when it comes to kids and young people, is learning
        new things. The youngest can expand their vocabulary and learn a foreign language by watching movies. A good
        documentary or an intelligent historical drama can educate you on important issues and events.

        Also, watching movies can change our perspective on the people and issues we face every day. We can learn new
        languages, about other cultures, about historical events, and much more just by watching movies.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>7. Make children more creative</h3>
    <p>One study found that kids who watched fantasy films like Harry Potter have scored significantly higher in tests
        of creativity. Such movies help them to develop creative ideas and use imagination in solving problems. And not
        only children, but many adults also get various creative ideas after watching an interesting movie.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>8. Help us deal with difficult situations</h3>
    <p>Movies are not just a form of entertainment. They often teach us lessons and help us deal with difficult
        situations. According to Gary Solomon Ph.D., MPH, MSW, the author of two books on cinema therapy, if you’re
        facing some difficult life situation, you should choose movies with themes that mirror your current problems or
        situation. Let's give some examples.

        If your loved one or someone in your family is struggling with addiction, try watching Clean and Sober or When a
        Man Loves a Woman. Another research found that the symbol of the ring in Lord of the Rings has been used by
        recovering addicts as a way of understanding their struggle. And if you’re coping with serious illness or death
        of a loved one, any movie with such a topic could help you with overcoming these issues.</p><br><br>
    <h3>9. Help you appreciate art</h3>
    <p>Although movies are a form of entertainment in the first place, they are also a form of art. Pictures, costumes,
        sound design, architecture, theatre, and other elements of movies, are all part of the art. Many painters,
        designers, sculptors, musicians, and other artists work together to create a combination of all these arts,
        which is called a movie. Watching movies help us appreciate art and often make us interested in some kind of art
        or artist.</p><br><br>
    <h3>10. Escape from reality and entertainment</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, we just need to escape from reality for a while and get away from problems. And what better way to do
        that than watching movies in your cozy bed? Movies create a feeling of happiness and make us people laugh when
        nothing else can. Besides, movies were always one of the best kinds of entertainment. They’re something that
        will always improve your mood and make you have fun.</p>
